location
========

location is a set of drupal features for managing map based points of interest with drupal.  drupal displays information about the POI and shows a map for each location. drupal also provides leaflet and views driven displays of POIs based on categories in areas chosen bny the user.

our inspiration is OpenStreetMap, and the desire to share all the great stuff being stored inside OpenStreetMap. 

leaflet is included and used for all map displays. the node and views features will both have maps and will be pre-configured for display of OpenStreetMap layers.

taxonomy included uses a set of tags derived from the most commonly managed POIs in the OpenStreetMap database. these are locations people go to, use, visit, or otherwise interact with. when you have your own site using these features you can add additional terms.

this project is sponsored by the Local Routes Foundation. educational and development organziations working with maps and sustainable tourism can contact us to find out more about how to put these features to work for you.
